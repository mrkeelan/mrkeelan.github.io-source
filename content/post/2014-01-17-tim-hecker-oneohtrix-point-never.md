I got to see this show at Lincoln Hall, January 16th, 2014 as part of the Tomorrow Never Knows festival. I was unsure what to expect from this show as both these bands albums are kind of ambient electronic music. I&#8217;ve liked both of these albums a lot. I often listen to them through headphones at work. It&#8217;s a nice backdrop for getting work done, but there&#8217;s also interesting stuff going on in there if you want to listen intently.

Tim Hecker was first. He came out to no real fanfare, and went to work on a dark stage, obscurred by a smoke machine. I&#8217;m not sure of what all the equipment he had on stage was. It looked like he was constantly tweaking things. There was a lot going on sonically. Visually, it was difficult to see what was going on. The crowd was standing almost perfectly still, just listening, and drinking their beer. I think some visual component would have added to the show. Personally I would like to see what he was doing up there.

Oneohtrix Point Never closed the show. They had a screen showing trippy CG animations, as well as logos from old video games. I saw Zork go by up there. They put on a pretty good set. It was 2 guys with laptops up there. It didn&#8217;t seem like as much equipment as Tim Hecker had.

Overall, I thought this was an interesting show, two acts playing music I don&#8217;t usually see live. It&#8217;s not at the top of my list to see again, but was enjoyable.

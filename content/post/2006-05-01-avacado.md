Pearl Jam&#8217;s new album is officially released, Tuesday May 2nd. I received my pre-ordered copy Friday. Thanks, Ten Club.

It&#8217;s a really good album. Upon first listen I thought Riot Act was a much better ablum, and wasn&#8217;t sure why this one was so over-hyped. Riot Act IS a great ablum, which doesn&#8217;t get the respect it deserves, but this self-titled album is really good too. It is growing on me.

I wasn&#8217;t sure about &#8220;Marker in the Sand&#8221; at first, but now I think it&#8217;s my favorite song on the album. &#8220;Come Back&#8221;, &#8220;Gone&#8221;, and &#8220;Inside Job&#8221; are all great songs. &#8220;Life Wasted&#8221; is my favorite of the heavier rock stuff, and the reprise is cool too.

Initially I thought the album kinda lulled in the middle, but &#8220;Marker In The Sand&#8221;, &#8220;Unemployable&#8221; and &#8220;Gone&#8221; are all great. &#8220;Big Wave&#8221; is my least favorite song on this release.

I&#8217;m still not sure what&#8217;s with all the hype, about this being their &#8220;[best album in ten years][1]&#8220;, or &#8220;[return to eminence][2]&#8221; (This guy also says it&#8217;s their first studio release since 2000, so he doesn&#8217;t even count Riot Act). To me it sounds pretty much like Pearl Jam has since Matt Cameron joined (although &#8216;Binaural&#8217; sounded much better live than in album form, to me at least). It&#8217;s not amazingly better than &#8216;Riot Act&#8217;, not at all, and it doesn&#8217;t sound like Vs. or Ten.

All in all it&#8217;s a good album, from a band that has continuously put out good albums. I can&#8217;t wait to see them perform these songs live in a couple weeks.

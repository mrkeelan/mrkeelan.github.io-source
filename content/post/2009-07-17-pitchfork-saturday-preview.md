**Cymbals Eat Guitars** 1:00 (A)

I really like the album &#8220;Why There Are Mountains&#8221;, especially &#8220;Share&#8221;. Looking forward to starting out Saturday watching this band.
  


**Plants and Animals** 1:45 (C)

**F\***ed Up** 2:30 (A)

I&#8217;m excited to see these guys live. Should be the heaviest band of the day.

**The Pains of Being Pure at Heart** 3:20 (C)

**Final Fantasy** 4:15 (A)

**Yeasayer** 5:15 (C)

I really like the &#8220;All Our Cymbals&#8221; album, tribal chillout music.

**Doom** 6:15 (A)

Should be interesting, I like his stuff. I wonder if he&#8217;ll really show up, or if we&#8217;ll get a [Doomposter][1]

**Beirut** 7:25 (C) or **Matt & Kim** 7:30 (B)

I can&#8217;t decide on this one. Matt & Kim are fun band, but Beirut does some very interesting stuff too. I&#8217;m leaning toward Beirut now.

**The Black Lips** 8:30 (B) or **The National** 8:40 (A)

I will probably stick with The Black Lips, because I saw The National at Lollapalooza last year, albeit from far away saving a spot for NIN.

Yesterday we went to Sentosa Island. It&#8217;s a small island off of Singapore, and a theme park type place. We took a cable car over to it, from Harbour Front, where our office is located. It was a pretty cool place. We went up in the Sky Tower, where you could see a pretty good view of the island, the city, and the ocean, as it rotated around. Then we went to the underwater world aquarium, and got to see fish, sharks, stingrays, and giant crabs. The luge was very cool, kind of a go-cart race down a hill, then take a chair lift back up, lots of fun. There was a dolphin show, which was pretty good, although it was extremely hot there, and the dolpin&#8217;s were kind of far away. There was a lot of construction going on too, the park was still under developement. There were a few beaches It was a lot of fun there, and wasn&#8217;t too crowded, although the 7:40 musical fountain show was full, at 7:15, and we had to wait for the 8:40. That was pretty good, cool laser effects, and fountain effects, and a weird cartoon projected onto water. Then we took the cable car back, and went in for a night of work. A long day, but good.

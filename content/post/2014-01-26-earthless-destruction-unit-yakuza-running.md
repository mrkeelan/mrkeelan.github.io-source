This show at the Empty Bottle was phenomenal.   All four of these bands put on great shows, and the Bottle is such a great venue.  It had some weird sponsorship thing with Red Bull, so you had to RSVP to get in for $5, but it was first-come first-serve, no guaranteed ticket.  So we got there a little before 9, and the first band didn&#8217;t start until 9:45.

Running was first, and I&#8217;m glad I got there to see them.  They had a kind of psych-punk-rock vibe, with echo-y difficult to decipher vocals. Very energetic. They&#8217;re from Chicago, so I&#8217;ll have to make sure to check them out again.

Yakuza came next, and put on a good set as always.  Noise-y metal with saxophone flourishes from singer/saxophonist Bruce Lamont.  Good stuff.

I had never seen Destruction Unit before, nor listened to any of their stuff before the show.  I was blown away.  They played a great, spacey, punky, jammy psyche-rock set, tons of energy, going nuts on stage.  This is a band meant to be seen live.

Earthless closed out the night.  This was the band I was most excited to see, and they lived up to expectations, and the exceptional bill of this concert.  Instrumental Hendrix-style riffs, with guitar chops to back it up.  These long slow-burn jams to stand back and let the music wash over you.  Really good stuff.

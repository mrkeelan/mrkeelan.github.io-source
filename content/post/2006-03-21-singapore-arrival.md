We arrived in Singapore Saturday evening, after I slept for pretty much the entire flight from London. The airport was very nice, and very clean, out side there were palm trees and flowers, I could tell immeadiately how nice it was here. It was 35 degrees Celsius, about 95 Farenheit, when we arrived. It cooled off as the sun went down. The weather has been very nice, doesn&#8217;t feel too hot. We took a cab to the apartment, cab rides are pretty inexpensive here.
  
The apartment we are staying in is very nice, and there is a lot to do in the surrounding area. We went out for dinner close by, the food here is unbelievably good, everything, very good.
  
We walked down Orchard Street, a major street here, lots of shops, coffee shops, and restaurants around, a few bars, and lots and lots of people around. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot more walking here than I had been in Chicago, it&#8217;s been nice.
  
This week we are working a regular 9am-4pm, or so, Singapore time schedule, it&#8217;s nice to be on a regular schedule, to get off work, go out for dinner, and drinks, and then go to sleep. I realize I have been getting a little sick of the 3rd Shift schedule, after a year of working it.
  
Singapore is really great so far, I&#8217;m very glad to be lucky enough to be here right now.

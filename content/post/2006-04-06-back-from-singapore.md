I am now back in Chicago. My appologies for not updating much last week.

Friday I had to work in Singapore at night. Joe came in friday night and will be working the next two weeks in Singapore, as I am home now.

So, Saturday Joe and I went out to lunch, and to explore Orchard Road. We went to eat at a place called Cafe Cartel, I think. The food was pretty good, the place was kind of strange, they took your order, and immeadiately brought out a receipt, we paid for it, and then they crossed stuff off as it was brought out to us. Joe wondered aloud, what happens if we want more to drink, or are these free refills? 

Me, to the waiter 
  
- &#8220;Can we have more drinks, please?&#8221;

Waiter (with the most confused look I have ever seen anyone give, like when someone asks George Bush an unscripted question, times ten) 
  
- &#8220;More drinks???&#8221;

Joe
  
- &#8220;Yes, two more drinks&#8221;

Me
  
- &#8220;Yeah, we had the Peach Iced Tea, two more of them.&#8221;

Waiter (still very confused)
  
- &#8220;You want two more glasses to drink?&#8221;

Then he radios to someone, and a receipt is quickly brought out for two glasses of peach iced tea. It would be 30 minutes or so before those drinks would be brought out.

So, if you&#8217;re ever eating at a Cafe Cartel restaurant in Singapore, or possibly anywhere, remember that you will only be able to get one drink. A second drink is such an odd request, that it can&#8217; really be handled.

Saturday night we all went out the see Ice Age 2, myself. It was pretty good, I hadn&#8217; seen the first one, so don&#8217;t know if it was better.

Monday and Tuesday we went to Sentosa during the day, went on the luge again, rented bikes, and ate lunch there. Monday thunder and lightning started before we had a chance to go swimming, so we went back Tuesday, and went swimming first, then we got caught in the storm while riding around the bike trails.

Tuesday night we went out for one last good dinner, for me. We went to a nice Japanese restaurant, had some sushi, sake, steak, and wasabi ice cream.

My trip to Singapore was great. I wouldn&#8217;t mind going back&#8230; <img src="http://matthewkeelan.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png" alt=":-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />

If you ever need to quickly get the hex color code of something, to add it to a CSS file perhaps, here’s a quick way to do it in OSX Mountain Lion.
  
Open **DigitalColor Meter**, it’s under Utilities in the Applications menu. Change the view to hexadecimal, **View > Display Values > as Hexadecimal**. Then hover over the color you want and press **Shift + Command + C**. Now it’s in your clipboard and **Command + V** will paste it.

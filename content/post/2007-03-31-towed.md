My car was towed this morning. The sign with the Giant Snowflake on it was supposed to indicate that I couldn't park there, even when it's 50 degrees out. What a pain that was, wasted 4 hours off my day. Sometimes I really hate this city.

So, then I worked from home for the rest of the afternoon. I moved my desk upstairs, it's a really nice set up now.

I'm going to the Bulls game tomorrow, should be good.

Goodnight.

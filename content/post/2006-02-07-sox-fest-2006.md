I attended SoxFest 2006, with my friends Brad, John J., and Jesse.

It was cool. We got to hear Ozzie Guillen, Ken Williams, and Hawk talk about the amazing 2005 World Series Championship season, and what is sure to be a great 2006. We also got to see an introduction to Jim Thome, and Rob Mackowiak, as well as new radio voice, and former Sox player, Chris Singleton. Thome should be a good addition if he is healthy next season, and Mackowiak should be a good utility player. Singleton can&#8217;t replace Rooney, who was always excellent, but hopefully he&#8217;ll be ok, at least he&#8217;s not Mike North, I guess.

All in all SoxFest was great, and next season should be too.

Sunday we went to try and find a sushi place called Aoki, but it could not be found. We went to a Chinese place, had a nice meal and some sake. I never had Sake before, it was good, tastes like vodka, but a lot smoother, doesn&#8217;t burn your throat, and isn&#8217;t as strong.

Then we went back to the bar with the beer garden, and the cover band, the older guy who sang Elvis songs came back, he&#8217;s entertaining, I asked them to play anything Pearl Jam, and they played Last Kiss. It was good. I had a black cactus &#8211; tequilla, blackberry brandy, and soda water, not a bad drink.

Monday we started work. The buiding is nice, not as big as the one in Chicago, but the office is pretty nice. They have a caffeteria with about a hundred different food stands. I had some kind of chicken, and fresh banana juice.

Monday evening we went to a fancy/expensive Indian restaurant. It was excellent, wine, naan bread, chicken, lobster, all excellent. 

I got to chill in the pool for a bit after work, it was quite relaxing, though the pool area was pretty much empty.

After a short, 8 hour, flight from Chicago to London, we had a ten hours to spend there before the flight to Singapore. We went out site-seeing in London. It was cool, did a lot of walking, and riding the London Underground, which is cleaner, quicker, and much nicer than the CTA, although it's also more crowded.

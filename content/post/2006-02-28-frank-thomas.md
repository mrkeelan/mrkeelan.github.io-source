I think Frank Thomas and Ken Williams [both][1] [talk][2] [too][3] much.

I will say that I would rather this happen now, than at the end of last season. It could have distracted from the great season the White Sox brought us last year. Dispite whatever Frank wants to say now, as a long-time fan, I&#8217;m glad he was a part of the 2005 White Sox, I&#8217;m glad I got to see him throw out the first pitch of the playoffs, and I&#8217;m glad I was able to see him hold up the World Series Trophy at the rally, after the parade. Those moments will be remembered for much longer than comments reported in the off-season, and spring training anyway.

I will miss Frank Thomas being on the White Sox (especially if he contributes to the Oakland A&#8217;s usual destruction of the Sox), even if Ken Williams doesn&#8217;t. I think Frank deserves a great deal of respect and honor for the career he had here. Ken Williams should have stuck with his original plan that he stated at SoxFest, to not speak publicly about bad-blood that goes on behind the scenes.

I&#8217;m glad I got to see Frank Thomas hit so many home runs for the White Sox, and become the greatest hitter in franchise history. I think holding a World Series Trophy over his head at an extremely well-attended victory rally is a fitting end to Frank Thomas great White Sox career, even if he doesn&#8217;t.

Pitchfork Music Festival is coming up next week. A lot of great bands are playing should be cool to see.

## My Friday Schedule

5:00 Tortoise, 6:10 Yo La Tengo, 7:20 The Jesus Lizard, 8:40 Built To Spill
  

  
**Tortoise** 5:00 
  

  

  
**Yo La Tengo** 6:10 
  

  

  
**The Jesus Lizard** 7:20 
  

  

  
**Built to Spill** 8:40 
  

  

  
Pick of the Day: **Tortoise** too bad that they&#8217;re at 5pm, a lot of people will probably miss them.
